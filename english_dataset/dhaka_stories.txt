TITLE: Syria welcomes lifting of US sanctions

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Friday welcomed the permanent lifting by the United States of the so-called Caesar sanctions, paving the way for the return of investments to the war-ravaged nation.

The US Congress on Wednesday permanently ended the sanctions imposed on Syria under Bashar al-Assad, who was ousted in December last year.

The Caesar Act, named after an anonymous photographer who documented atrocities in Assad’s prisons, severely restricted investment and cut off Syria from the international banking system.

“Today is the first day that Syria is without sanctions, thanks to God Almighty, and then to your efforts and patience for 14 years,” Sharaa said in a recorded video in the first post of his official X account.

Sharaa gave his “special thanks to (US) President Donald Trump... for responding to the call of the Syrian people, and to the members of Congress for recognizing the sacrifices of the Syrian people.”

Trump had already twice suspended the implementation of sanctions against Syria in response to pleas from Saudi Arabia and Turkey, allies of the new government headed by Sharaa, a former jihadist.

But Sharaa had sought a permanent end to the sanctions, fearing that as long as the measures remained on the books they would deter businesses wary of legal risks in the United States, the world’s largest economy.

Earlier on Friday, a Syrian foreign ministry statement welcomed the step, calling it “an entrance to the phase of reconstruction and development.”

It urged “all Syrians in the country and abroad to contribute to national recovery efforts.”

TITLE: Air ambulance for Khaleda Zia not arriving on Tuesday

The air ambulance scheduled to take BNP Chairperson and former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia to London will not be arriving in Dhaka on Tuesday.

The aircraft was earlier scheduled to land at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 8am on Tuesday. However, the operator has sought cancellation of the previously granted permission.

A Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) official confirmed the development, saying the German-based FAI Aviation Group submitted a formal request through the local coordination agency to withdraw the approved landing slot.

“We will forward the cancellation request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for necessary further action,” the official told reporters.

However, Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport Executive Director SM Ragib Samad said he had not yet received any official communication confirming that the air ambulance would not arrive.

Earlier, based on the operator’s application submitted on Sunday, authorities had approved the aircraft’s landing at 8am on Tuesday, with a scheduled departure from Dhaka around 9pm the same day.

TITLE: Trump says does not need Congress to launch strikes in Venezuela

US President Donald Trump asserted Thursday he does not need congressional approval to launch strikes on land against Venezuela despite criticism that he is already exceeding his constitutional authority with attacks at sea.

When a reporter asked whether he would seek authorization from the US lawmakers to hit drug cartels on land in the Latin American country, Trump said he’d have no problem doing that, although he cited concerns that politicians “leak like a sieve.”

“I wouldn’t mind telling them, but you know, it’s not a big deal. I don’t have to tell them,” he said in the Oval Office.

The United States has conducted multiple air strikes since September against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, causing at least 99 deaths and prompting heated debate about the legality of the operations.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro claims the US campaign seeks regime change instead of its stated goal of stopping drug trafficking.

According to the US Constitution, while the president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, only Congress has the authority to formally declare war -- a point raised not just by the Democratic opposition but also some lawmakers in the president’s party, although most Republicans have supported him.

“The president has failed to demonstrate the necessary authority under US or international law to conduct lethal military strikes on these boats,” Democratic representative Gregory Meeks said during a House debate.

“No one can credibly claim that these vessels, in some cases not even traveling to the United States and located thousands of miles from US soil, posed an imminent threat to the American people warranting the use of military force,” he said.

Experts say Trump could order limited military strikes inside Venezuela without Congress, but only temporarily and only if framed as defensive or limited in scope.

After the 9/11 attacks on the United States, Congress authorized the use of military force for US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which was also cited for counterterrorism operations in other countries.

TITLE: Top NCP leaders among 20 high-risk individuals assigned gunmen protection

The government has assigned gunmen to 20 high-risk individuals, including six top leaders of the National Citizen Party (NCP), editors of daily Prothom Alo and The Daily Star, as part of heightened personal security measures ahead of the upcoming national election.

Home Adviser Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury told journalists on Monday after a Law and Order Committee meeting at the secretariat that while the country’s overall security situation remained normal, these individuals were identified as facing serious risks.

Several frontline leaders of the July movement have already been provided with personal protection, and the Ministry of Home Affairs said the process of issuing personal firearm licenses for self-defense is ongoing.

Police sources said the NCP leaders who have received gunmen include:

Other high-profile figures on the list include Nurul Haque Nur and Md Rashed Khan, president and general secretary of Gono Odhikar Parishad, respectively.

Applications for gunmen and arms licenses have also been submitted by several other politicians and election candidates. Among them are:

Additionally, the family of Shaheed Osman Hadi, a prominent activist in the anti-fascism and anti-hegemony movement, was being brought under special security. One sister has been granted an arms license and a gunman, while full-time police protection will be provided for other family members.

Home Ministry sources said, to date, at least 15 politicians and nearly 25 government officials have applied for arms licenses or security details. Intelligence agencies are reviewing applications to prioritize protection for those at greatest risk.

Inspector General of Police (IGP) Baharul Alam said: “Gunmen have been assigned to those at high risk. Stopping targeted killings is a difficult task; no country in the world has been fully successful at it. We are striving to keep law and order under control ahead of the elections.”

Meanwhile, a meeting to review the national security situation was held at the state guest house, Jamuna. Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus stressed that law and order must be maintained at all costs as the country approaches the national election.

TITLE: Cold wave grips Sreemangal as temperature falls to 11°C

Severe cold has been prevailing in Sreemangal of Moulvibazar district for the past two days, disrupting normal life in the area.

The minimum temperature was recorded at 11°C at 9am on Sunday, the same as on Saturday, according to the Sreemangal Meteorological Observatory.

The district, surrounded by hills, haors and tea gardens, has been particularly affected by the cold spell.

Senior assistant of the Sreemangal Meteorological Observatory, Anisur Rahman, said although temperatures remained low, sunshine since morning provided some relief.

“The lowest temperature recorded today was 11°C, similar to yesterday. The presence of bright sunlight has helped reduce the intensity of the cold during the day,” he said.

However, temperatures continue to drop significantly after evening, especially in haor areas, hills and tea gardens.

Sreemangal Upazila Nirbahi Officer Islam Uddin said winter clothes and blankets are being distributed in tea garden areas through private initiatives and that the upazila administration will carry out distribution in phases.

TITLE: Home Adviser: Prayers most needed for Hadi now

Home Affairs Adviser Lt Gen (retd) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury on Thursday urged people of the country to pray for the recovery of Inquilab Mancho spokesperson Osman Hadi who was shot in the head on December 10.

“You all please pray for our younger brother Osman Hadi so that he can recover and come back to us. Please also pray for him after Juma prayers tomorrow. Pray for him with sincerity,” he said while talking to reporters at the Secretariat .

He also urged followers of other religions to pray for Hadi.

Meanwhile, Dhaka University Central Students’ Union (DUCSU) Vice President Abu Shadik Kayem on Monday demanded the resignation of the home adviser if three demands, including the arrest of those involved in the attempt to kill Osman Hadi, are not met.

When journalists drew his attention to the progress in arresting those involved in the attack and to the resignation demand, the Home Adviser declined to make any comment.

TITLE: Adviser Touhid: National election will be a major test for law enforcers

Highlighting the role of law enforcers in holding a fair election, Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said on Saturday the upcoming parliamentary polls will be a major test for law enforcement agencies.

“Although there were initial challenges, the police have now organised themselves effectively. Ahead of the election, law enforcement must remain vigilant. Those defeated in the polls may attempt to create disorder. Our aim is to ensure a smooth election and hand over responsibilities to the newly elected government,” he said.

The adviser was speaking at a meeting with Rangpur district officials at the Deputy Commissioner’s conference room.

On agricultural exports, the adviser said potato exports are under consideration but challenging due to limited global demand.

Turning to manpower export, Touhid Hossain stressed the importance of sending skilled workers abroad as wages remain low if they are not skilled manpower.

People must be trained to work abroad efficiently and numerous nursing positions are vacant overseas and sending trained nurses can ensure better income and benefit the country, he said.

Regarding livestock, Hossain highlighted the potential of local cattle in Rangpur, noting that their meat is highly sought after, including in Dhaka, and urged livestock initiatives to capitalise on this market.

Chaired by Deputy Commissioner Md Enamul Ahsan, Superintendent of Police Md Marufat Hossain, Civil Surgeon Dr Shaheen Sultana, Rangpur Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Tofayel Ahmed, and District Livestock Officer Dr Abu Zaid, were, among others, present at the event.

The adviser is now in Rangpur on his four-day visit.

TITLE: Egg prices fall as production outpaces demand

Commercial egg prices have dropped sharply in recent weeks as increased production has pushed supply well beyond demand, leaving farmers across Rajshahi and surrounding districts counting losses.

On December 4, farmers in Rajshahi sold white eggs at Tk7.10 each and brown eggs at Tk8.10 — rates producers say are at least Tk 1 lower than production cost.

Zearul Islam, 32, a farmer from Kolipur in Godagari, said prices typically fall during winter, “but this year the drop is too steep for us to survive.”

Zearul, who runs a farm with 6,500 hens producing about 5,300 eggs daily, said prices fell by Tk1 per egg since October. “I incurred Tk 50,000 in losses in November alone,” he added.

He said more farms and higher production, along with abundant winter vegetables and local fish, have reduced consumer demand for eggs.

Sujon Ali, 26, a layer farmer from Dohachhi in Godagari with 2,200 hens, said his farm’s production rate is above 90%, but he is forced to sell white eggs at Tk7 each, against a production cost of Tk8.

“If this price continues, we will have to spend from our own pockets to keep the farms running,” he said.

Mohammad Asaduzzaman, 27, a new farmer in Afi Nepalpara, Poba, said he produces around 1,250 eggs a day from 1,300 hens. “I am happy with my production, but I am unsure how long I can continue if the price remains this low,” he said.

Traders echoed the concern. Mizanur Rahman, manager of Rocky Traders in Poba, said they buy around 55,000 eggs daily to supply wholesale markets in various districts. “Demand has declined in many markets, and farmers are suffering due to the lower prices,” he said.

Joynal Abedin, a trader and poultry farmer in the same area, buys over 150,000 eggs daily to supply across the region. “We are struggling to sell eggs. I have already halved production at my own farm to 15,000. Many small farmers may not survive in this market,” he warned.

Kazi Zahin Hasan, director of Kazi Farms, said egg prices reflect supply and demand conditions. “High prices over the last few years encouraged farmers to increase production,” he said.

He noted the absence of accurate data on national output, particularly eggs laid by backyard poultry. “However, we estimate commercial farms are now producing over 52 million eggs per day. At this time last year, the figure was about 35 million. The current low prices clearly indicate that supply exceeds demand.”

Responding to allegations of price manipulation, he said: “Some government officials claim a cartel controls egg prices. But if there were a cartel capable of controlling prices, why would it let prices fall? With thousands of farmers selling eggs daily, this is a competitive market.”

Asrar Chowdhury, economics professor at Jahangirnagar University, said egg prices fall rapidly when supply exceeds demand because eggs are perishable. “Winter brings abundant substitutes such as vegetables. When these are reasonably priced, consumers shift for variety,” he said.

He added that the egg market is highly competitive. “It is very difficult for any group of sellers or buyers to influence this market. Market forces, the availability of substitutes, and perishability have combined to push prices down.”

TITLE: Governor: Financial sector reforms showing visible progress despite challenges

Bangladesh Bank Governor Dr Ahsan H Mansur on Monday said despite the difficulties the financial sector is moving toward a more sustainable footing with visible progress.

The central bank has already undertaken extensive reforms to restore stability in the banking sector, curb inflation, and stabilise the exchange rate despite facing multifaceted challenges, he said.

The governor was speaking at a seminar on the publications Bangladesh State of the Economy 2025 and Sustainable Development Goals: Bangladesh Progress Report 2025, held at the Planning Commission in the capital.

The governor said when he assumed office, the country was battling rapidly depreciating currency, declining reserves, rising non-performing loans, liquidity stress and disrupted trade flows.“I was always convinced that without stabilising the exchange rate, we would never win the fight against inflation.”

He added that the exchange rate was around Tk 120 per dollar when he took office has since stabilised under a fully market-based system.

“Reserves that had dropped to around US$17 billion have increased by around US$10 billion in one year,” he said.

The governor made it clear that there is no scope for an immediate reduction in interest rates.

Despite inflation falling from 12.5 percent to just over 8 percent, he stressed the need to maintain a slightly positive real policy rate.

“Monetary policy will remain fully market-driven. Administrative control over interest rates is not an option,” he said.

He also pointed out that the government’s borrowing requirements have put pressure on the money market, but Bangladesh Bank has strictly avoided money printing.

The governor acknowledged that the actual non-performing loan (NPL) situation had long been understated.

“We brought transparency. The real NPL figure is more than 35 percent—uncomfortable but truthful,” he said.

He said Bangladesh Bank has already restructured the leadership of 14 banks, initiated processes for five banks into one bank and resolution of nine non-bank financial institutions, and advanced key legal reforms, including the Deposit Insurance Act, Bank Resolution Ordinance, and amendments to the Bank Company Act.

The Bangladesh Bank Order is also under review to reinforce central bank autonomy and accountability, he added.
