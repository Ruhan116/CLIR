TITLE: CEC vows to thwart any centre-grabbing efforts | Top News

RAJSHAHI, Aug 23, 2025 (BSS) - Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) AMM Nasir Uddin today issued a stern warning against any attempts to seize control of polling centres during the upcoming 13th Jatiya Sangsad election, saying that such actions would lead to immediate cancellation of votes from the affected centres.

"Anyone dreaming of capturing polling centres will face consequences. Their dreams will be shattered this time as we are fully prepared to respond," the CEC told a view-exchange meeting with election officials at the Regional Public Administration Training Centre here.

About the ongoing election preparations, CEC Nasir Uddin stated that all necessary measures are being taken under the guidance of the Chief Adviser to ensure the national election is held in February, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan.

"We don't want to go inside the speeches of any political party about holding the election. We are performing our constitutional duties," he added. Addressing over the election process, the CEC said that the existing Constitution does not allow for proportional representation and, as such, the Election Commission (EC) is bound to follow the current legal framework. "If the law changes, we will act accordingly," he added.

The Bangladesh Army, CEC Nasir Uddin said, would not serve as a striking force but would support law enforcers. There are no current plans to reshuffle Deputy Commissioners (DCs) or Superintendents of Police (SPs), he added. The Commission, he said, has around 5,700 trained officers, many of whom have experience from previous elections. However, those who were found involved in past irregularities will be excluded from election duties this time.

"There is no pressure from the government on the Election Commission," he said, adding, "Should there be any interference, I will step down rather than remain in office."

About the participation of political parties, CEC Nasir Uddin said the Awami League is currently facing trial and their participation in the election will depend entirely on the outcome of the legal proceedings.

With Regional Election Officer Delwar Hossain in the chair, the meeting was concluded with the CEC issuing several directives to ensure free, fair and credible elections in the Rajshahi region.

TITLE: Sri Lanka ex-president Ranil Wickremesinghe arrested | International

COLOMBO, Aug 22, 2025 (BSS/AFP) - Sri Lanka's former president Ranil Wickremesinghe was arrested on Friday for allegedly "misusing government funds", a senior police detective told AFP.

Wickremesinghe was taken into custody after being questioned about a September 2023 visit to London to attend a ceremony for his wife at a British university while he was head of state, the officer said.

"We are producing him before the Colombo Fort magistrate," the officer said, adding that they were pressing charges for using state resources for personal purposes.

Wickremesinghe had stopped in London in 2023 on his way back from Havana, where he attended a G77 summit.

He and his wife, Maithree, attended a University of Wolverhampton ceremony.

Wickremesinghe had maintained that his wife's travel expenses were met by her and that no state funds were used.

However, the Criminal Investigation Department of the police alleged that Wickremesinghe used government money for his travel on a private visit and that his bodyguards were also paid by the state.

Wickremesinghe became president in July 2022 for the remainder of Gotabaya Rajapaksa's term, after Rajapaksa stepped down following months of protests over alleged corruption and mismanagement.

Wickremesinghe is credited with stabilising the economy after the country's worst-ever financial meltdown in 2022.

He lost his re-election bid in September.

DHAKA, Aug 24, 2025 (BSS) - The university administration has taken stringent measures to prevent cyberbullying and maintain order to ensure a fair and peaceful Dhaka University Central Students' Union (DUCSU) and Hall Union polls.

In this regard, the university administration has requested the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) to temporarily suspend several online platforms, including 'Dhaka University Nirapotta Mancha', 'Dhaka University Chhatro Shongshod-1', and 'Chhatro Shongshod-2' until September 10.

All activities of the Green Future Foundation and its shuttle service will remain suspended during this period due to potential influence on the election.

The administration also asked candidates to remove campaign billboards and banners from the campus.

Alongside the voluntary services, gift distribution, monetary support, or hospitality by candidates will be considered as violation of the electoral code of conduct.

Officially campaigning will be allowed from August 26 to September 7 (until 11 PM). Before that no campaign would be allowed.

Even during the campaign period, social or financial assistance, religious gatherings, or events in religious institutions will be prohibited.

Violations of these rules will be punishable offence under Clause-17 of the election code. These measures aim to ensure a neutral and peaceful election process, DU sources said.

DHAKA, Aug  21, 2025 (BSS) – Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami Assistant Secretary General Hamidur Rahman Azad today said that the necessary level playing field for free and fair elections is yet to be established in the country, stressing the need for ensuring equal opportunity for all political parties in the electoral process.

He made the remarks while speaking to journalists following a meeting with Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) AMM Nasir Uddin at the Election Commission headquarters in the capital’s Agargaon.

A five-member delegation from Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, led by Hamidur Rahman Azad, participated in the meeting with the CEC.

Azad said, “We have no objection if the election is held in February. We proposed to the Commission to announce a timeline for holding elections either in February or April.”

He added, “However, if the government believes preparations are completed  and intends to hold the election in December this year, Jamaat-e-Islami has no objection to that either.”

Regarding the demand for elections under the Proportional Representation (PR) system, Hamidur Rahman Azad said, “We are strengthening this demand by building public opinion.”

“We have presented this issue not only to the government but also to the people. We have addressed it in our meetings and rallies across the country. Gradually, the public is starting to support this system,” he added.

He further noted that following the July Uprising, a new political expectation has emerged among the people. “People now aspire to see a refined and modern political framework. From that perspective, we believe the people of Bangladesh are now expressing support for the PR system.”

WASHINGTON, Aug 24, 2025 (BSS/AFP) - Hungary's Marton Fucsovics steadied after a late lapse to capture his third ATP title on Saturday, holding off Botic van de Zandschulp 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) in the final of the hardcourt tournament in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

In the final tune-up for the US Open, which starts on Sunday in New York, 33-year-old Fucsovics called on all of his experience after squandering a match point with a double fault at 5-2 in the second set.

Van de Zandschulp, seeking his first ATP title, forced the tiebreaker, but Fucsovics took advantage of his Dutch foe's errors in the decider to pull off the victory.

"I'm speechless, really," said Fucsovics, who hoisted the trophy in Bucharest last year, six years after his first career triumph in Geneva.

"I had a long career, a couple of trophies," he said. "I'm 33 and a half years old. So, I belong to the older generation, but I'm still here, winning an ATP 250.

"So I will keep on fighting," Fucsovics said. "I'm enjoying tennis right now. I'm going to play as long as I can."

The next challenge is the US Open, where Fucsovics is slated to face Canadian Denis Shapovalov in the first round.

Van de Zandschulp, who stunned Spanish star Carlos Alcaraz in the second round at Flushing Meadows last year, is due to launch his campaign at the final Grand Slam of the year against 11th-seeded Holger Rune.
