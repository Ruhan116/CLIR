TITLE: 3 killed, 74 injured in two-day Mali protests

Death toll of the two-day violent protests in Mali's capital Bamako has increased to three, and at least 74 others were injured, local hospital authorities told Xinhua on Saturday afternoon.

There was also significant material damage, particularly in the country's National Assembly which was looted by protestors.

At least six leaders of the demonstrations were arrested Friday night and Saturday, said the June 5 Movement — Rally of Patriotic Forces (M5-RFP), organiser of the protests.

In a message published by the Malian presidency Friday night, President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita regretted the scenes of violence, and reaffirmed his "wish to continue the dialogue" with the protesters.

To ease the tension in the country, Keita has made several proposals to end the crisis, which the protesters rejected and called for the appointment of a prime minister in its ranks and the resignation of Keita.

The capital were largely paralyzed since Friday when the demonstrations turned violent.

TITLE: Tesla slashes Model Y SUV price as pandemic weighs on auto sector

Tesla Inc cut the price of its sport utility vehicle Model Y by $3,000, just four months after its launch, as the U.S. electric carmaker seeks to maintain sales momentum in the COVID-19 pandemic.

The reduction follows price cuts in May on Tesla's Model 3, Model X and Model S.

The company headed by Elon Musk this month posted a smaller-than-expected fall in car deliveries in the second quarter, resilient results despite the pandemic that hit the global auto industry.

The Model Y now starts at $49,990, down nearly 6% from its previous price of $52,990, according to the carmaker's website.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The company started deliveries of the Model Y in March, promising a much-awaited crossover that will face competition from European carmakers like Volkswagen AG rolling out their own electric rivals.

In April, Tesla had said the Model Y was already profitable, marking the first time in the company's 17-year history that one of its new vehicles turned a profit in its first quarter.

TITLE: IAEA found uranium traces at Iran 'atomic warehouse' - diplomats

Samples taken by the UN nuclear watchdog at what Israel's prime minister called a "secret atomic warehouse" in Tehran showed traces of uranium that Iran has yet to explain, two diplomats who follow the agency's inspections work closely say.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is investigating the particles' origin and has asked Iran to explain the traces. But Tehran has not done so, according to the diplomats, stoking tensions between Washington and Tehran. US sanctions have slashed Iranian oil sales and Iran has responded by breaching its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

In a speech a year ago Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vehemently opposed the deal, called on the IAEA to visit the site immediately, saying it had housed 15 kg (33 lb) of unspecified radioactive material that had since been removed.

Reuters first reported in April that the IAEA, which is policing the nuclear deal, had inspected the site - a step it had said it takes "only when necessary" - and environmental samples taken there were sent off for analysis.

Israeli and US media have since reported that the samples turned up traces of radioactive material or matter - the same vague language used by Netanyahu.

Those traces were, however, of uranium, the diplomats said - the same element Iran is enriching and one of only two fissile elements with which one can make the core of a nuclear bomb. One diplomat said the uranium was not highly enriched, meaning it was not purified to a level anywhere close to that needed for weapons.

"There are lots of possible explanations," that diplomat said. But since Iran has not yet given any to the IAEA it is hard to verify the particles' origin, and it is also not clear whether the traces are remnants of material or activities that predate the landmark 2015 deal or more recent, diplomats say.

The IAEA did not respond to a request for comment. Iranian officials were not available to comment.

Israel's UN ambassador, Danny Danon, said on Twitter that the IAEA had verified Israel version. "The (Iranian) regime must be held to account and not given a free pass," he tweeted.

NETANYAHU: "I'M NOT RELENTING"In a live video chat on Facebook, ahead of an election next week, Netanyahu was asked about the Reuters report.

"I know the issue is being handled by the IAEA. I do not intend to discuss this today. It's very possible that I will have something to say about it tomorrow," Netanyahu said.

"But it is certainly an important issue - let me tell you, it's the most important issue as far as our future is concerned. And I am not relenting for a moment."

The 2015 nuclear deal, which Netanyahu opposed, imposed tight restrictions on Iran's atomic program in exchange for sanctions relief, and was based on drawing a line under Iran's past activities. Both the IAEA and US intelligence services here believe Iran had a nuclear weapons program that it ended more than a decade before the deal.

Iran says its nuclear ambitions have always been peaceful.

Hawks such as Netanyahu, who has repeatedly accused Iran of seeking Israel's destruction, point to Tehran's past to argue that it can never be trusted. The Islamic Republic's previous secrecy might explain why uranium traces were found at a location that was never declared to the IAEA.

The IAEA takes environmental samples because they can pick up telltale particles even long after material has been removed from a site. Uranium traces could indicate, for example, the former presence of equipment or material somehow connected to those particles.

Cornel Feruta, the IAEA's acting director-general, met Iranian officials on Sunday. An IAEA statement said afterwards: "Feruta stressed that these interactions (on its nuclear commitments) require full and timely cooperation by Iran."

The United States, pulled out of the nuclear deal last year by President Donald Trump, is trying to force Iran to negotiate a more sweeping agreement, covering Tehran's ballistic missiles and regional behavior, than the current accord.

Iran says it will not negotiate until it is granted relief from US sanctions, which France is trying to broker. In the meantime, Iran is breaching the deal's restrictions on its nuclear activities step-by-step in response to what it calls US "economic warfare".

A quarterly IAEA report issued a week ago did not mention the sample results because inspection-related matters are highly confidential. But it did say Iran's cooperation could be better.

"Ongoing interactions between the Agency and Iran...require full and timely cooperation by Iran. The Agency continues to pursue this objective with Iran," the report said.

US RAISING PRESSUREIt is far from the first time Iran has dragged its feet in its interactions with the IAEA over the agency's non-proliferation mandate. The IAEA has made similar calls in previous reports, in relation to promptly granting access for inspections.

The IAEA has likened its work to nuclear accounting, patiently combing through countries' statements on their nuclear activities and materials, checking them and when necessary seeking further explanations before reaching a conclusion, which can take a long time.

The process of seeking an explanation from Iran has lasted two months, the IAEA's safeguards division chief told member states in a briefing on Thursday, diplomats present said. But he described what it was seeking an answer to far more generally as questions about Iran's declaration of nuclear material and activities, since the details are confidential.

"It is not something that is so unique to Iran. The agency has these cases in many other situations," a senior diplomat said when asked about the current standoff with Iran. "Depending on the engagement it can take two months, six months."

That does not mean all member states will be happy to wait.

"IAEA Acting Director General going to Iran just as IAEA informs its Board that #Iran may be concealing nuclear material and/or activities," US National Security Adviser John Bolton said on Twitter on Saturday. "We join with other @iaeaorg Board member states eager to get a full report as soon as possible."

The IAEA's policy-making, 35-nation Board of Governors holds a week-long quarterly meeting starting on Monday.

TITLE: More frustration for Inter as Verona snatch late 2-2 draw

Inter Milan allowed yet another game to slip from their grasp as Verona snatched a late equaliser to hold them to a 2-2 draw in Serie A on Thursday.

Antonio Conte's side appeared to have done the difficult part when they came from behind to lead 2-1 early in the second half only for Miguel Veloso to level for Verona with five minutes left.

That means Inter stay fourth with 65 points, having been overtaken by Atalanta after their 2-0 win over Sampdoria on Wednesday, and are 10 adrift of leaders Juventus with seven games to play. Verona are ninth with 43.

"It's disappointing because we deserved to win the match and instead we have lost more important points," said Conte.

"The fact that we have lost 20 points from leading positions must give us pause for thought. We've lost so many points in a stupid way — if we hadn't, the table would look very different."

Since the Serie A restart, Inter have been held 3-3 at home by Sassuolo after conceding twice in the last 10 minutes and on Sunday they lost 2-1 to visitors Bologna after leading 1-0 and missing a penalty — a performance which left Conte fuming.

They also got off to a disastrous start on Thursday when Federico Dimarco sent a ball over the top of the Inter defence and Darko Lazovic flew past Milan Skriniar and scored from a narrow angle in the second minute.

It could have been worse as Veloso's shot scraped the post and Dimarco was close with another effort but Inter survived and turned the game around after the break.

Antonio Candreva levelled four minutes into the second half, scoring from a rebound after Romelu Lukaku's shot hit the bar, and he was also involved in the second goal six minutes later.

After being released on the right, Candreva's shot was deflected off Dimarco's chest and slipped between goalkeeper Marco Silvestri and his near post.

Lautaro Martinez was denied a third for Inter when he broke clear only to denied by Silvestri and Verona seemed to have run out of gas.

But, in a tale that has become all too familiar for Inter, the hosts snatched an equaliser when Amir Rrahmani slipped between two defenders and laid the ball off to Veloso who fired past Samir Handanovic.

TITLE: Microsoft cloud flagship posts first growth under 50%; bookings growth steady

Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) flagship cloud computing business Azure reported quarterly sales growth of under 50% for the first time ever on Wednesday, sending the tech giant's shares down 2%.

Revenue in Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment rose 17% to $13.4 billion, with 47% growth in the Azure component, which includes essential computing and storage services. Analysts on average had expected cloud revenue of $13.09 billion in the fourth quarter ended June 30, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Azure's growth is the most direct measure of performance against top cloud rival Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services, as Microsoft does not break out Azure's revenue by dollar amount. AWS posted revenue growth of 33% to $10.2 billion, which analysts believe exceeds Azure's total, for the quarter ended March 31. International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), another Microsoft rival, this week beat Wall Street expectations with strong cloud growth.

Beyond Azure, Microsoft's results showed how the novel coronavirus is both helping and hurting Microsoft.

Businesses are investing in cloud technology for remote work, and the video game Minecraft scored a record 132 million monthly active users as families worked and played from home. But Microsoft's forecast for some versions of its Office software slightly missed expectations because of weak sales to struggling small and mid-sized businesses.

"No one can take away from the fact that GDP is going to be negative," Chief Executive Satya Nadella told investors on the company's earnings call, referring to US Gross Domestic Product.

Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said 12% commercial bookings growth, which reflects corporate contracts for future software and services, was roughly unchanged from the previous quarter and beat company estimates. The figure signals that customers are keeping long-term technology spending plans intact.

"Our strong position in the cloud has allowed us to have good results and support our customers as they work on the next couple of years of digital transformation," Hood said in an interview.

Microsoft's total revenue rose 13% to $38.03 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $36.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (bit.ly/3jxrriP)

The growth was powered by its More Personal Computing unit as more people worldwide used its products to work on Windows PCs and play games on Xboxes during lockdowns. Revenue from the unit, the largest by sales, rose 14% to $12.9 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $11.46 billion.

Microsoft said its professional networking site, LinkedIn, was hurt by the weak job market and advertising spending cuts.

Net income fell to $11.20 billion, or $1.46 per share, from $13.19 billion, or $1.71 per share, a year earlier.

TITLE: Impact boss Henry kneels for 8 minutes, 46 seconds at MLS game

Montreal Impact manager Thierry Henry took a knee for eight minutes and 46 seconds at the start of their Major League Soccer game against New England on Thursday to show his support for the campaign against social injustice.

Henry, who also wore a T-shirt with the slogan 'Black Lives Matter', took a knee inside his technical area at kick-off in memory of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for the same amount of time.

"Well I sat down for eight minutes and 46 seconds, I guess you guys know why. So that was just to pay tribute and show support to the cause, that was basically it and pretty simple," Henry said at a post-match news conference.

The former Arsenal and France striker had called last month for urgent action to be taken to stop racism in the wake of Floyd's death.

Impact lost 1-0 in Thursday's game, their opener in the "MLS Is Back" tournament.

TITLE: Marvel's Muslim Superhero ‘Kamala Khan’ to feature in game

Marvel's Avengers are gearing up to entertain the fans with their blockbuster video game.

Apart from featuring the regular marvel superheroes the likes of Iron man, Captain American and Hulk. The game will also see the debut of the first Muslim superhero, according to reports by BBC.

Kamala Khan is a Muslim American teenager of Pakistani heritage who happens to have shape-shifting abilities. She is the latest character to adopt Ms.Marvel moniker.

The publisher for the avenger's game is Squire Enix who is famous for Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series. Squire said that Kamala Khan AKA Ms Marvel will be a main playable character in the upcoming video game and will play an integral part in the storyline.

This news has been received with high praise from fans and industry insiders.

Kamala Khan was created in 2014. By Marvel editor and director, Sana Amanat. Amanat herself is from Muslim-American background. She wanted to create a character that girls from a similar background could relate.

During the promotion of the game, she said, "I think it's absolutely insane that Kamala is in one of the biggest Marvel games that we've done."

Ms Marvel Moniker has been used several times in the Marvel comic books and in the big screen. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, she is played by Brie Larson.

Kamala Khan was introduced in 2014 as a 16 year old Pakistani-Muslim girl growing up in Jersey City. She is also a fan-girl of the Avengers.

This is hardly the first time that gamers will be able to play as a Muslim character. In recent years, Muslim characters have appeared in top-selling franchises from Assassin's Creed Chronicles to Street Fighter V. Yet, gamers have complained in many occasions of the characters being stereotypical.

The game is set to come out in September 2020. Ms Marvel will also be featured in her own live-action series which will be aired in 2022.

TITLE: Everybody suddenly wants a carrom board

Abul Bashar is busy on a call with a client – taking orders for carrom boards. He has just received an order of ten carrom boards. Such orders are coming every now and then, for the last four months, shared Bashar.

To supply the orders, his workers are busy in cutting wood, measuring plies, sticking nails, burnishing and colouring the carrom boards, in a factory. They are working relentlessly to deliver the boards on time.

The factory is actually a dark room where piles of wood and plies are kept in rows. With the lights turned on, they are working side by side. There is a tiny bed in the shadow for them to take rest. With a crosscut saw, workers are cutting plies leaving sawdust as residue. Sawdust and the smell of spirit is making the air mildly suffocating.

The workers have however gotten accustomed to working like this all day long. It takes a minimum of a day and a half to prepare a carrom board.

"It is a team work. Each of them are assigned to do an exact task and only when we put everything together does a carrom board come to shape," explained Bashar while supervising the workers.

Ever since the pandemic started, while most other businesses have experienced sharp declines, Bashar has seen his business grow. The same is true for most carrom board factories on the Aga Sadek lane. All of them are working hard amid this pandemic to meet the extra demand of customers.

S. M. Alamgir Hossain, another carrom board businessman, says, "I am in this business for the last 32 years but this is the first time that I have seen people buying carrom board like Hajir Biriyani, standing in a queue. And because of its sudden demand, the price has also increased over the last few months."

Badol Saha, an Old Dhaka resident, has come to buy carrom boards for his children and his in-laws. A year ago, when Badol bought this exact carrom board, it cost him only Tk400. Today, it costs Tk600. Yet, he has bought it.

"My teenaged children are at home and bored. In the beginning, they had a tendency to go outside every once in a while. Then I started to play carrom with them. Now, they are voluntarily staying at home and competing with each other," said Badol.

Usually, the price depends on the size and material that have been used to make these pieces. Nine sizes are available in the market now. Considering the size and quality, the price of carrom board can range between Tk400 and Tk5,000.

Usually this is the peak time for sale of carrom boards. But this year, the peak started much earlier. During the pandemic, they had great business behind the closed shutters. In the last few months, each factory owner has profited a minimum of 20% to 60%.

Police had seen them working but did not interrupt them. They were allowed to work inside the factories.

Nonetheless, they struggled to meet the growing demand. Soon enough, factory owners were in dire need of ply, wood and other raw materials. In most cases, the raw materials comes from Chattogram to Dhaka. Due to the shutdown, transportation was limited.

As the businessmen failed to procure raw materials in bulk, the price increased. In some cases, the price almost doubled.

Beauty, the proprietor of Prince Carrom factory, said they get a huge number of orders but they do not have enough manpower to make them.

"Workers went outside Dhaka by the end of March and they could not come back. A few of them returned and we have resumed work. Being empathetic to their situation, I could not even force them to come back," shared Beauty.

There are at least forty factories in Old Dhaka that produce carrom boards. But its rising demand has seen a few seasonal businessmen enter the market too as it takes little investment for beginners. A person can start this business with twenty thousand taka and one or two workers.

Experienced businessman Alamgir shared that these businessmen would not be able to sustain in the market, as a few months later they will incur losses. "This is detrimental to regular businessmen. Maybe we could do more business if they had not come in the scene," said Alamgir.

Over the years, businessmen like Alamgir have actually experienced a steady decline in the demand for carrom boards. Smartphones have taken over our habit of indoor games. This pandemic, however, has put a smile on their faces again. They are hoping people will rediscover its charm and appreciate indoor games more.

"An indoor game like carrom can be played with everyone. It is a great way to spend time and to strengthen bonds with family members," opined Ashraf Ahmed, general secretary of Bangladesh Carrom Federation.
