TITLE: Swatch buys Harry Winston  jewellery arm for $750m
DATE: 2013-01-15T00:00:00+06:00

Jeweller Harry Winston is selling its high-end watches-to-necklaces division to Swatch Group in a $750 million cash deal that expands the Swiss watchmaker's luxury offering and lets the Canadian group concentrate on its diamond mines.
Monday's deal reverses a 2004 acquisition which turned Harry Winston, the group that discovered what became Canada's Diavik diamond mine -- now controlled by Rio Tinto -- into a miner and jeweller.
The original mining arm is renamed Dominion Diamond Corporation after the sale of the Harry Winston luxury business, which started as a small jeweller in New York in 1932 and rapidly became a favourite with movie stars.
For Swatch, the deal is evidence of the benefits of strong Asian demand for watches, handbags and other high-end items that has given companies the firepower to expand their portfolio.
Harry Winston - which Marilyn Monroe mentioned in her song "Diamonds are a girl's best friend" - has the potential to generate more than 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.10 billion) in sales and 250 million net profit in about 4-5 years, Swatch chief executive Nick Hayek told Reuters in an interview.
Swatch Group is already the world's biggest watchmaker by sales, with 8.1 billion francs sales in 2012 thanks to brands such as Omega. Buying Harry Winston allows it to enter high-end jewellery, a market dominated by Richemont with its flagship brand Cartier.
"If watches continue to grow as dynamically as in 2012, 9 billion franc sales are within reach in 2013. Now in view of this acquisition, it can of course be even more," said Hayek.
For the group, which is best known for its colourful Swatch plastic watches, the deal marks a new attempt to get a foothold in high-end jewellery. Its partnership with U.S. jeweller Tiffany ended in 2011 with the companies suing each other.
Swatch Group and Dominion Diamond Corporation will continue to work together through a diamond sourcing deal under Monday's purchase, which includes Swatch taking on $250 million of debt. The two companies will also consider opportunities for a joint diamond polishing venture.

TITLE: TICFA: not now, says govt again
DATE: 2013-01-03T00:00:00+06:00

Bangladesh has no immediate plan to sign TICFA as the country needs more time to set much higher labour standards tagged by the US as a precondition with the trade and investment cooperation deal, an official said.
The US wants immediate elimination of child and forced labour from all sectors and permission for trade unionism at factories, but Bangladesh wants to implement these conditions in phases.
The US has been pressing Bangladesh for signing the Trade and Investment Cooperation Framework Agreement (TICFA) for several years.
The latest call came in December.
â€œBangladesh will call Assistant US Trade Representative for South Asia Michael J Delaney in Dhaka soon to discuss the issue,â€ said an official of the commerce ministry after a TICFA-related meeting at the secretariat in Dhaka yesterday.
Commerce Minister GM Quader, Foreign Minister Dipu Moni, and Prime Minister's Foreign Affairs Adviser Gowher Rizvi were present at the meeting, chaired by Finance Minister AMA Muhith.
Earlier, Delany came to Dhaka to discuss the TICFA issue in April 2011, but both the countries failed to reach any consensus.
If signed, TICFA will offer a platform for Bangladesh and the US to discuss bilateral trade issues, including trade barriers, opportunities and investment in the two countries.
The commerce ministry official said the Bangladesh government sat in a meeting after receiving a letter from Bangladesh embassy in Washington in December. In the letter, the US government urged Bangladesh to sign the deal as soon as possible.
â€œBut, Bangladesh cannot do so in absence of a consensus regarding the labour rights issue,â€ the official said. â€œThe US wants to see the practice of trade unionism in Bangladeshi factories soon, which is not possible for the country right away,â€ he said.
After the meeting, Muhith said TICFA is a matter of negotiation and it is still continuing.
â€œThis is the seventh or eighth round of meeting. We have no plan to place the TICFA issue in the cabinet meeting now,â€ he said.
During her visit to Bangladesh in May last year, the immediate past US secretary of state Hillary Clinton also discussed the TICFA issue.
Ahead of Hillary's visit, Bangladesh had finalised the draft of TICFA agreement and it is now awaiting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's approval, the commerce ministry official said.
In the first US-Bangladesh partnership dialogue in Washington during September 19-20, both the countries discussed the TICFA issue.
The TICFA came as a second effort from the US after the first one -- the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) -- did not get through.

TITLE: <i>In-laws torture her for dowry, police refuse to take case without bribe</i>
DATE: 2012-11-23T00:00:00+06:00

A housewife has been inhumanly tortured allegedly by her in-laws for failing to meet their dowry demand at Monohorkhali village under Kutubdia upazila.
Police refused to take any case in this connection as they were demanding Tk 10,000 as bribe, alleged the father to the victim.
Family members said, victim Rozina Akther, 23, mother of a two-month-old baby, was married off to Jamal Uddin four years ago.
Soon after the marriage, the in-laws started to torture her for dowry. Her father Mir Kashem gave a good sum in several phases but it failed to bring happiness to Rozina.
On December 15, 2009 Rozina filed a case with the judicial magistrate court, accusing six of her in-laws.
However, following assurances from the local elders, the case was withdrawn.
But a few days ago, the in-laws returned to their former state and started to brutally torture Rozina, leaving her unconscious.
The in-laws then fled their houses, fearing that Rozina had died of torture.
On information, police rescued her in the morning on November 21 and sent her to upazila health complex.
As her condition deteriorated there, Rozina was shifted to Cox's Bazar General Hospital where she is now fighting for life.
Contacted, officer in-charge (OC) Md Abul Hashem of Kutubdia police station refuted the allegation of demanding bribe.
MAN JAILED IN JESSORE
Away in Jessore, a court on Wednesday sentenced a man to two years' rigorous imprisonment (RI) for torturing his wife for dowry, reports UNB.
The convict was Polash Kumar, son of Shashi Baunia at Boalia village under Bagarpara upazila of the district.
After examining all witnesses and evidence, Chief Judicial Magistrate Sheikh Mafizur Rahman pronounced the verdict against Polash. He also fined him Tk 500, in default, to suffer one month more in jail.
According to the prosecution, Lipika Rani, daughter of Bimal Kumar Biswas of the same village, was married off to Polash by paying Tk 50,000 out of Tk 1 lakh demanded as dowry.
In 2003, Polash forced Lipika out of the house as she failed to bring the rest Tk 50,000 from her parents.
Later, he brought Lipika back home again after the matter was settled at a local arbitration.
But he drove her out of the house again, demanding dowry, within six months.
On February 7, 2004, Lipika lodged a case against her husband.

New Zealand pacer Tim Southee (L) appeals during the third day of the second and final Test against Sri Lanka at the P Sara Oval in Colombo yesterday.Photo: AFP
For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
Thilan Samaraweera hit a half-century under pressure to lead Sri Lanka's recovery on the third day of the second and final Test against New Zealand at the P Sara Oval in Colombo on Tuesday.
Sri Lanka were in big trouble on 103-5 before finishing the day on 225-6 in reply to New Zealand's first-innings 412, thanks to the middle-order batsman's defiant 76 not out off 156 deliveries.
Samaraweera, who had injured his finger while fielding, received valuable support from lower-order batsman Suraj Randiv, who made a resolute 102-ball 34 not out, his highest score in 12 Tests.
The pair have so far added 97 and helped their team avoid the follow-on. But the tourists were in control when bad light stopped play with 25.4 overs remaining in the day.
Sri Lanka, leading the series 1-0 following their 10-wicket win in the opening Test, are still 187 behind with four wickets in hand.
Fast bowler Tim Southee, who took two wickets in an over on Monday, had Sri Lanka -- resuming on 43-3 -- in trouble in the morning when he struck twice before Samaraweera and Randiv steadied the innings.
Angelo Mathews and opener Tharanga Parana-vitana put on 90 after three wickets had fallen for just 12 on Monday but Southee dismissed them in successive overs.
Paranavitana (40) edged the paceman to wicket-keeper Kruger van Wyk while Mathews (47) fell to a superb one-handed catch by Martin Guptill, who held the ball low to his right in the slips.
New Zealand had wasted an earlier chance to break the fourth-wicket stand when skipper Ross Taylor dropped Paranavitana at first slip off fast bowler Trent Boult when the batsman was on 32.
Mathews played some aggressive shots in the morning, lofting off-spinner Jeetan Patel over wide long-on for the first six of the innings and then cutting the bowler past point for four.
Southee has so far taken four wickets for 51 off 19 overs.

TITLE: Textbook distribution for students starts tomorrow
DATE: 2014-01-01T00:00:05+06:00

The government is set to start free distribution of nearly 30 crore copies of new textbooks among about four crore students of primary and secondary level tomorrow amid opposition's blockade.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will begin the distribution symbolically through giving textbooks to some students of different grades at Gono Bhaban in the capital at 11:00am today.
The education ministry will hold the much-awaited “Textbook Festival Day” tomorrow, as schools and madrasas will remain shut today on the occasion of Akhri Chaha Shamba. Usually the festival is held on the first day of a year.
Education Minister Nurul Islam Nahid will inaugurate the festival at Government Laboratory School in the capital around 11:00am.
The opposition's blockade, however, stirred a concern of disruption in the smooth distribution of textbooks across the country.
"We have completed all preparations to distribute the books to our children. They will come to school and return home happy with a set of new textbooks," the minister told The Daily Star yesterday.
He called upon the opposition parties to keep at least a particular period of a day out of the purview of the blockade so that students can get their books.
"Our appeal to keep the examinations out of hartals and blockades was ignored time and again. Yet we are appealing to the opposition parties to do this favour as a part of their responsibility towards the new generation," Nahid said.
The students have become accustomed to getting books on the first day and any disruption will discourage them, the minister added.
This year, the government will distribute more than 29,96,75,938 copies of textbooks to more than 3.74 crore students of primary, secondary, ebtedai (primary level of madrasa), dakhil (secondary level of madrasa) and vocational classes of the 2014 academic session.
National Curriculum and Textbook Board officials said despite facing tremendous problems in sending the books to upazilas due to persisting blockades, they have been able to take books to the destinations.
Against a backdrop of severe textbook crisis, the government had taken up the mammoth task of distributing textbooks to students free of cost in 2009 and since then has been distributing books at the very beginning of academic sessions.
