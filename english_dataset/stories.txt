TITLE: Majority of Britons wants quit EU

Well over half of British voters now want to leave the European Union, according to an opinion poll that shows anti-EU sentiment is sweeping through all three main political parties.
The Opinium/Observer survey finds that 56% of people would probably or definitely vote for the UK to go it alone if they were offered the choice in a referendum.
Overall just 28% of likely voters think the EU is a "good thing" while 45% think it is a "bad thing". The 18-34 age group is the only one in which there is a clear majority backing the EU, with 44% saying membership is good, against 25%.

TITLE: English pride at stake

Battered England are desperate to avoid the ignominy of a 5-0 series whitewash against Australia as they scramble to salvage some pride in the final Ashes Test in Sydney starting on Friday.
Alastair Cook's team -- coming off a dispiriting eight-wicket loss in the fourth Test in Melbourne -- face becoming only the third English side to lose an Ashes series 5-0 to their oldest rivals.
It has been a tour from hell for England with the loss of senior players Jonathan Trott (stress) and Graeme Swann (retirement), star players out of form and Kevin Pietersen admitting his team-mates are "mentally fragile" from playing in back-to-back Ashes series.
England have so far used 15 players and there are expected to be changes for Sydney, with Gary Ballance, Scott Borthwick and Steven Finn mentioned as possibilities. In contrast, Australia have been unchanged in all four Tests.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan believes the tourists will be unable to stop the Mitchell Johnson-led Aussie juggernaut in Sydney with the same team that succumbed in Melbourne in four days.
"It is not easy for them. England will not do this with the same XI. There is too much baggage, there are too many scars," he wrote in an English newspaper.
As England's tour has unravelled so has the pressure cranked up on Cook as skipper.

TITLE: Naeem's hard work pays dividends

For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
In the recently concluded domestic league match between Rangpur and Barisal, Naeem Islam occupied the crease for more than seven hours for his century. He eventually carried his bat, recorded his highest first-class score and left the field only after his ten other Rangpur teammates were out.
It was the kind of batting display that Naeem, after his six sixes in an over in the Dhaka Premier League in 2009 and his three big hits that rescued the Tigers -- the same year -- from the grasps of defeat against Zimbabwe, was lesser known for.
Naeem's century at Mirpur yesterday, which majorly guided Bangladesh's reply, was a mere reflection of the 'other side'. Popularly known as 'sixer-Naeem' amongst his mates, the batsman displayed the more disciplined-side of his in his innings yesterday.
According to Naeem, the reason why he had to don the more aggressive approach was quite simple. "When you come to bat at number 8, there is very little a batsman can do. So I always tried to hit the ball towards the fence as hard as possible. I have always been a grafter in the longer version of the game. I try to be aggressive in the shorter version," he said at the post-day conference.
The Bangladesh batsman's 108 might not look as presentable on the scoreboard as the two hundreds and a double-century by the visitors, it however, displayed the result of an immense amount of hard work.
A glance at Naeem's first-class record this year reveals a lot. Right from Bangladesh A's tour to India to the ongoing National Cricket League, the middle-order batsman has been in the runs. In the four innings that he played in the NCL preceding the Test series, he scored two centuries and spent the highest amount of time at the crease.
While the Shakibs, Tamims and Mushfiqurs failed, Naeem got it right. It wasn't just about reaching that golden three-figure mark, rather it was the way he anchored both the partnerships that took the home side out of trouble. Shakib survived a caught behind due to a no-ball, Tamim skied a few before getting caught at mid-off, Naeem though, for the six and half hours that he spent at the crease, played an almost chanceless innings.
Naeem's game-plan, it seems, resembles the way he speaks, plain and simple. "My plan remains the same throughout. I play a very few shots. I play strokes only when the ball is within my zone, if it isn't I leave it," he said.
"Batting with Shakib also helped me. There was lesser pressure. The way Shakib and Tamim bat is always a delight to watch. I enjoy their batting but at the same time, I try to play my own game," added Naeem.
The 25-year-old batsman, who in fact belongs to a more senior batch as compared to most of the players in the current Bangladesh squad, claimed that his repeated attempts to return to the national side made him 'stronger mentally'.
"When you play bad, you naturally get dropped and you have to perform well to make a comeback. I feel it had helped me," said Naeem.
"Before the NCL began, [chief selector] Akram bhai asked me to play at number 4 position for the team. That's when I thought I had a realistic chance to get back into the team. I have been putting in a lot of efforts since then," he added.
There are obviously a number of factors that could perhaps dilute the value of his innings: the flat wicket, the slow strike-rate or even the tired poke outside the off stump that eventually cost his wicket. He in fact acknowledged the disappointing end to his innings on his own. "It was just a bad shot," said a disgusted Naeem with a shrug of the head.
However, his innings displayed a refreshing change from the traditional aggressive batting approach followed by most of the top-order batsmen. Yesterday was perhaps one of those rare days when majority of the Bangladesh fans found it more entertaining to see a batsman 'grit' it out at the wicket, instead of playing those boundary-strokes.

Companies engaged in international trade are facing growing threat from fraud and forgery and the recent scams in some state banks have shaken private commercial banks, a business leader said.
Now the genuine companies find it hard to access loans from banks, Mahbubur Rahman, president of International Chamber of Commerce Bangladesh (ICCB).
â€œThe commercial banks are also taking extra precautionary measures in opening of LCs, and if this trend continues, the much needed development of the country's industrial base will be in jeopardy,â€ Rahman said.
Rahman spoke at a seminar on "Trade fraud in Bangladesh: challenges and remedies" organised by ICCB at the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry auditorium on Wednesday.
"The recent scam is nothing but a straight cheating by some so-called companies in connivance with a group of bank officials and influential group," he said in a statement yesterday.
Bangladesh Bank must be given full autonomy to monitor the activities of state banks like private commercial banks, he said.
There should not be any interference of the Banking Division of the finance ministry to operate the state banks, Rahman said, adding that Bangladesh Bank and all commercial (both public and private) banks should also develop modern fraud detection mechanism and take early action.
Bangladesh has been growing fast in the international trade. Both import and export are increasing at substantial rate. Bangladesh is now considered to be an emerging trading nation with a trade volume of $60 billion.
As the international trade is growing, all parties involved in the trade are also getting exposed to the risk of fraud, Rahman said. â€œThe more the market of import-export is expanding the more we are facing the risk of unknown events including fraud."
It is important to recognise that domestic and international financial liberalisation heighten the â€œrisk of crisisâ€ if not supported by prudent supervision, regulation and appropriate macroeconomic management, he said.
The global financial crisis has created an urgent need to fundamentally rethink how financial systems should function and how it should be regulated.
DCCI President Asif Ibrahim said the country has been maintaining a steady growth despite high interest rate, energy crisis toppled with street agitation and frequent hartals. "It has been possible only due to the vibrant private sector who deserves the credit for being the engine of growth."
He suggested the age-old policies should be replaced with new and pro-active ones to create a more investment-friendly environment to attract both local and foreign investment.
He said the investment level should be increased from present 6-8 percent of GDP to 25-35 percent over the next few years to achieve a higher GDP growth rate. BIBM Director Toufic A Choudhury said higher rate of document rejection has become apparent following current economic crisis and fall in commodity prices.
In the context of Bangladesh, there are instances where banks reject documents just for rejection and charges for the discrepancies as their foreign counterparts do, he said. "These are clear departures from the UCP morals. Such practices can simply make the trade costlier and burdensome to the consumers."
To retain the clients in this competitive market, banks sometimes undertake undue risks even bypassing the regulatory framework which may harm the banking sector, he cautioned.
"Banking scam is not new in our country, but the difference is that in the past it was limited to only four to five accounts and now-a-days it is 30-60 accounts," said former Sonali Bank managing director Mohammad Hossain.
"So, it may be assumed that a substantial portion of banking loan has been disbursed fraudulently which is alarming for the industrial sector."

TITLE: Winter wellness: Myth and truth

For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
There are many myths persist about what problems can arise to our health during winter season. But most of them are not true scientifically. It is important to distinguish truth from myth, in order to reduce your winter risk by understanding some common myths â€" and the actual truth behind them.
Myth:
Bundle up or you will catch a cold.
Truth:
Being in the cold has nothing to do with getting a cold. The thing to remember is that viruses cause colds, not to weather. Cold viruses are passed from person to person, not through shivering temperatures. In fact, the reason colds spread faster in winter is because people are more likely to be inside within close proximity to each other.
Myth:
You should not exercise in the cold.
Truth:
It is absolutely fine to exercise in the cold, just make sure you warm up first. That may mean walking a bit before starting on a vigorous run, or avoiding a big hill until you are acclimated to the temperature. Sudden physical exertion in cold weather can, at times, be a risk for cardiovascular strain.
Myth:
I do not need sunscreen during the winter.
Truth:
The sun is lower in the sky in winter, but that does not mean you do not need to protect your skin. Even if you can not see the sun, it is still there. More importantly, its UV rays are still there as well. If you are going to be outside for a long amount of time, you need to wear sunscreen to protect your skin.
Myth:
You can not get allergies in the winter months.
Truth:
In the winter, there is good and bad news for allergy sufferers. If you have pollen allergies, they will be better in the winter, but if you are sensitive to indoor allergens, such as pet dander or dust mites, your allergies may be even worse. So although your sneezing and sniffling may not be from seasonal culprits, your indoor allergies could be more bothersome than usual.
Myth:
Hot meals will keep you healthier than cold meals.
Truth:
Most foods are better for us in their natural state. Once food is heated it begins to lose some nutrients. Hot foods are often comfort foods, and may make us feel better about the cold weather.

TITLE: AL men snatch bids in Barguna, Magura

Ruling Awami League (AL) activists went on rampage, foiling tender proceedings in Patharghata municipality under Barguna district on Sunday, while they snatched tender documents from the Public Works Department (PWD) office in Magura town yesterday.
Men allegedly led by the secretary of Patharghata municipality unit of AL snatched the box containing tender documents of the municipal development work, ransacked the municipal office and injured three councillors on Sunday, reports our Barisal correspondent.
Patharghata municipality authorities called tender for Tk 85 lakh development work in 16 groups on November 20 last year, municipality sources said, adding that 577 forms were sold and a good portion of them were dropped by December 20, the last date of submission.
Due to heavy rush of the tender participants, the municipal authorities arranged open lottery of the tenders at about 2:00pm on Monday.
But Mosharraf Hossain Sohrab, secretary of municipality unit of AL, demanded that the work under groups 1, 2 and 3 be given to him without any lottery.
As municipality Mayor Mallik Md Ayub, councillors, and other contractors opposed the demand, the men of AL and its associate organisations Bangladesh Chhatra League and Jubo League attacked their 'opponents', snatched the tender box, and looted furniture of the venue and the municipality office in presence of police, said witnesses, municipality officials and law enforcers.
The attackers allegedly led by Sohrab also physically assaulted councillors Abdul Malek, Abdul Karim and Mozammel Huq Polu.
Admitting the incident, municipality Mayor Mallik Md Ayub Hossain said, "As a large number of tenders were dropped, we arranged the open lottery as per rule and procedure under Public Procurement Act to check corruption and maintain transparency. An emergency meeting of the municipality authorities and its tender committees has been called on Monday evening to decide about the legal procedure and action regarding the matter."
Mosharraf Hossain Sohrab denied any incident of attack by his men and said, "The mayor earlier assured us to distribute the work on the basis of the negotiations among the tender participants and accordingly, we collected their signature of no-objection. But the mayor arranged lottery to distribute the works among his selected people and engaged in an altercation with us over the issue."
Our Magura Correspondent adds: Ruling party men allegedly led by a former BCL leader snatched tender documents from the box kept at the office of the PWD executive engineer in the district town yesterday.
"Shortly after I and another contractor on behalf of 'Galaxy Associates' dropped tender papers of the Tk 50 lakh bid for construction of the office building of Criminal Investigation Department at around 11:00am, some armed youths led by former BCL leader Meer Suman took away the tender documents from the box in presence of police," contractor Rashedul Islam Rakhu told the local journalists.
When contacted, Meer Suman, also secretary of Magura district unit of Sheikh Russel Shishu Kishore Sangsad, refuted the allegation.
"Contractor Rakhu and his elder brother Makbul Hossain Makul, general secretary of the district unit of Sramik League, also a councillor of Magura municipality, had been controlling the tender process of PWD for several years. This time also, they were illegally trying to capture the Tk 50 lakh bid for construction of the CID office. As I protested the matter, the syndicate led by Rakhu and Makbul created chaos at the office and blamed me," Suman claimed.
When contacted, Magura PWD Executive Engineer Sarwar Ahmed admitted the snatching of tender papers and said, "I was not at the office when the incident took place. We have decided for a re-tender for the work."

TITLE: Key health issues in 2012

For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
The year 2012 is marked with some glorious achievements and released new crucial data in terms of health. At the end year 2012, we would like to highlight some of theses milestones to respect sincere endeavours behind these achievements and encourage people to do more in the coming year.
MDG target on drinking water met
On 6 March, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Unicef announced that the world had met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water. Between 1990 and 2010, more than two billion additional people gained access to improved drinking water sources, such as piped supplies and protected wells.
Progress on child survival
An estimated 6.9 million children died before their fifth birthday in 2011, compared to around 12 million in 1990, according to data released by WHO and partners. Progress is speeding up: over the last decade, the annual rate of reduction in child deaths was almost double that of the previous decade. While significant, progress is still insufficient to achieve MDG 4 of reducing under-five mortality by two-thirds by 2015.
New data reveal increases in hypertension and diabetes
The World Health Statistics 2012 report released on 16 May highlighted the growing problem of noncommunicable diseases. It showed evidence of a dramatic increase in the conditions that trigger heart disease and other chronic illnesses, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. One in three adults worldwide has high blood pressure â€" a condition that causes around half of all deaths from stroke and heart disease â€" and one in 10 adults has diabetes.
15 million babies born too soon every year
Each year, some 15 million babies in the world â€" 4 out of 100 in Bangladesh â€" are born before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed, according to a report by WHO and partners. The 'Born Too Soon' report provided the first-ever national, regional and global estimates of preterm birth. It revealed that preterm birth is the leading cause of newborn deaths worldwide, and that it is on the rise in most countries. Three-quarters of the 1.1 million annual preterm deaths could be avoided using existing, cost-effective interventions such as kangaroo mother care.
First guidance on use of antiretrovirals by HIV-negative people to prevent infection
On 20 July, just before the XIX International AIDS Conference, WHO issued its first guidance to countries considering offering HIV medication, known as antiretrovirals (ARVs), to HIV-negative people at high risk to protect them from infection. The recommendations were based on clinical trials indicating that a daily dose of ARVs taken by HIV-negative people, known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), is both safe and effective in preventing HIV. Studies showed that PrEP can reduce HIV infection by up to 75% among people who take their medicine regularly.

TITLE: Infighting costs JP its base

For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
The Jatiya Party is gradually losing its base in Rangpur, party chief Ershad's home district, due to feud among local leaders.
In the Rangpur City Corporation polls on Thursday, Md Sharfuddin Ahmed Jhantu emerged as winner, defeating closest rival Md Mostafizar Rahman Mostafa by 28,450 votes.
Jhantu, backed by Nagorik Committee, was unofficially declared as the first mayor of the city around 2:50am yesterday. He bagged 1,06,255 votes while Mostafa secured 77,805 votes from 178 centres.
Another mayoral candidate, ATM Abdur Rouf Manik, secured 37,208 votes.
Jhantu, Mostafa and Manik have one thing in common -- they are all former Jatiya Party leaders.
Back in 1990, Jhantu was elected chairman of Rangpur sadar upazila as a JP candidate. The upazila system was abolished in 1991 and revived in 1998.
In 1993, Jhantu, a JP favourite, won the mayoral polls of Rangpur municipality as a JP favourite. Later, he left the post and contested the parliamentary elections in 1996 with the party's ticket and became a lawmaker.
He joined Awami League in 2001, stood for the parliamentary election and lost it.
Jatiya Party leaders Mostafa and Manik were elected upazila chairman of Rangpur sadar and mayor of erstwhile Rangpur municipality respectively in 2009 and 2010.
In July this year, the Rangpur municipality turned into a city corporation.
The duo opposed the party decision to back Mosiur Rahman Ranga, president of Rangpur Jatiya Party, in the maiden city corporation election. Later, Ranga pulled out of the race at Ershad's instruction, party sources said.
Mostafa and Manik, both expelled from the party, fought the election.
Many locals now point out Ershad's filature in resolve the feud centring the election. They say Jhantu, an advisory committee member of Rangpur Awami League, bagged 1,06,255 votes while the other two got votes totalling 1,15,013.
Either Mostafa or Manik could have won the mayoral post, had any of them got the blessing of JP Chairman and former military ruler Ershad.
According to party insiders, many leaders like Sharfuddin Ahmed Jhantu and Nur Mohmmad Mondal left JP only because of intra-party feud.
JP secured all six constituencies in Rangpur in 2001 national elections.
In 2008, it took Rangpur-1, -2 and -3 and Awami League got the other three. However, the two parties were allies this time.
Jatiya Party in 2009 upazila parishad polls secured two out of eight upazilas; AL and independent candidates captured the rest.
Mosiur Rahman Ranga, also a JP presidium member, said let the city corporation polls be a lesson to the leaders, supporters and activists.
â€œThis lesson will be useful in the next general elections and restoring the base of JP,â€ he added.

TITLE: Twitter, YouTube analysis pinpoints IS strategy

Tweets and YouTube videos by fighters from the Islamic State group have allowed analysts to pinpoint their movements in Iraq and Syria, highlighting the group's increasing push towards government strongholds.
The data compiled by Britain-based analysts from
IHS Conflict Monitor
, and shared exclusively with AFP, shows how the Islamic State (IS) group is probing beyond the territory it currently holds and pushing the bulk of its forces towards Damascus and Baghdad.
IHS ranks the most reliable Twitter and YouTube accounts from known IS militants, as well as opposition activists and government sources, using the geo-location data from around 4,000 entries a month to map attacks ranging from assassinations to large-scale bomb attacks.
"The Islamic State is shifting its attention to the weakened Syrian government at the expense of losing territory to the Kurds in northern Syria," said Firas Abi-Ali, head of Middle East analysis for IHS.
An image grab taken from a video uploaded on October 10, 2014, by Aamaq News Agency, a YouTube channel, allegedly shows Islamic State group fighters on the outskirts of Ain al-Arab in Syria. Photo: AFP
"We see the group's operational reach goes far beyond the territory it controls," he added. "This is a continually expanding project, there is no limit to where they would stop."
The IHS data from March to May showed IS was making a tactical decision not to launch offensives against Kurdish forces on the northern front, which could leave its forces vulnerable to air strikes.
"Neither the Kurds nor the Islamic State appear interested in changing that front line," said Richard Jackson, deputy head of political violence forecasting at IHS.
An image grab taken from a video released by Islamic State group's official Al-Raqqa site via YouTube on September 23, 2014, allegedly shows Islamic State (IS) group recruits at a training ground in an unknown location. Photo: AFP
"That frees up IS fighters to push towards the capitals."
The exception has been a key border crossing into Turkey, Tal Abyad, which the Kurds recaptured from IS this week.
Tal Abyad was the main entry point for IS to bring in foreign fighters, weapons and supplies -- forcing the group to throw men and resources at trying to defend it.
But Jackson said that would be an exception, with IS forces continuing to press towards Syrian and Iraqi government strongholds.
"They're not strong enough to take Damascus because the strong Sunni threat in that region is (al-Qaeda affiliate) Jabhat Al-Nusra and Jaish Al-Islam, but they will push towards the Damascus-Homs road," cutting off the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad from his Alawite community's coastal stronghold of Latakia.
"Damascus is important, but Latakia is their home," said Jackson. "That frightens Assad supporters."
'Divide and conquer'
Abi-Ali said the team began the mapping project and ranking the reliability of sources in January 2014 to try to sift through the lies from all sides in the war.
"What we've seen in the Syrian conflict is groups over-reporting their activity to gain credibility. There were a lot of unsubstantiated claims that one side or another was winning," he said.
Given the speed of their movement, IS fighters have made little effort to disguise their locations on social media.
"They rely heavily on their mobility, they move between battle fronts quite quickly and effectively, so they are less worried about giving away their location," said Abi-Ali.
In Iraq, weak security forces and an ineffectual government mean IS is still able to make offensive gains despite a massive international effort involving thousands of air strikes, deliveries of weapons and other equipment and training for Iraqi forces.
The IHS data shows IS pushing into the capital, with 70 improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in Baghdad between February and April, as well as three suicide bombings.
"This is about undermining the enemy's will to fight," said Abi-Ali. "In their grander aspirations, it's about inflicting enough casualties that you bring down the government or spark an exodus of the enemy population."
Some IS operatives were members of the feared intelligence services under the regime of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, and the group has been able to infiltrate towns, villages and tribes to lay the ground for takeovers.
"They have really well-structured sleeper cells," said Jackson. "The beards come off. They speak against the Islamic State to see who disagrees. It's divide and conquer."
In the long-term, IS brutality and its totalitarian approach could provide an opening for other militant groups, including Al-Qaeda, which has been displaced by IS as the most active and feared jihadist organisation.
"Al-Qaeda tends to work with a group to take over an area and then back off, letting the local group run it," said Jackson, citing examples in Yemen and Syria.
"That sort of cooperative approach is more likely to pay dividends than the IS approach of mass executions and killing all the dissenters. But that's long-term, and we're talking years."
