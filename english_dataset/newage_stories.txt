TITLE: Khalil discusses political issues with US officials

National Security Adviser and High Representative for the Rohingya issue Khalilur Rahman on Friday met with senior United States officials in Washington DC where they discussed regional, political and security issues.

Bangladesh’s new Ambassador to the US Tareq M Ariful Islam was also present in the meetings.

During his meeting with Allison Hooker, Under Secretary for Political Affairs, she reiterated strong US support for the leadership of Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus and the steps taken by the Interim Goverment in regard to the upcoming elections in February, said a press release of the Chief Adviser’s press wing issued from Washington on Saturday.

Ambassador Hooker expressed support to Bangladesh’s efforts to resolve the Rohingya issue.

Khalilur conveyed sincere thanks to the US for announcing $60 million in aid to the Rohingyas at the UN International Conference on the Rohingyas held on September 30 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.

The security adviser discussed a broad range of bilateral matters during his separate meetings with Nicole Chulick, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, and Andrew Herrup, Deputy Assistant Secretary, according to the release.

Khalilur also met with Assistant US Trade Representative Brendan Lynch and discussed follow-up actions regarding recently concluded tariff negotiations.

He reiterated Bangladesh’s commitment to reduce the trade gap with the US and requested Lynch to consider further reduction in tariffs as the trade gap becomes narrower.

Lynch assured full consideration of the matter as the tariff agreement gets implemented and trade gaps get reduced, said the release.

TITLE: Russian oil exports hit lowest level since invading Ukraine: IEA

Russia’s oil export revenues dropped in November to their lowest monthly level since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022, the International Energy Agency said Thursday.

Russia is the world’s third largest oil producer and income from fossil fuels is vital for its state finances, under pressure from meagre economic growth and the mounting impact of sanctions and Ukrainian attacks on its energy sites.

Both volumes and prices have fallen, ‘dragging export revenues to their lowest since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,’ the IEA said.

Total revenue in November of $11 billion was $3.6 billion below last year’s figure.

The Russian finance ministry reported oil and gas revenues were down 22 per cent in the first nine months of the year to a total of $88 billion.

Ukrainian attacks on Russia’s sanctions-busting ‘shadow fleet’ and marine oil facilities have slashed almost half from Russia’s November seaborne oil exports through the Black Sea, the energy agency added.

‘After weathering significant unplanned refinery outages in November, tightness in refined product markets has eased, but sanctions in 1Q26 will provide fresh challenges,’ the IEA said.

In October, the United States unveiled some of the harshest measures yet on Russia’s energy sector, sanctioning its two biggest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil, in an attempt to force Moscow to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine.

This comes as Ukraine had intensified attacks on Russian refineries over the summer and early autumn, causing domestic petrol prices to spike and forcing some Russian regions to introduce fuel rationing.

A mix of high military spending, entrenched inflation and lower oil revenues has stretched the Russian budget.

Moscow is expected to post a $50 billion deficit this year, equivalent to around three per cent of GDP, and is raising taxes on consumers and businesses next year to try to reduce the gap.

TITLE: Preparedness urged as country faces growing earthquake risks

The Institute of Architects Bangladesh held a roundtable titled Earthquake: Reality, Perception, Awareness and Strategic Preparedness through Action at the IAB Centre at Agargaon in Dhaka on Thursday.

The event brought together experts to address Bangladesh’s earthquake vulnerability following recent seismic activities, said a press release.

The architecture community was represented by senior IAB fellows, including architect and urban planner Iqbal Habib; former IAB president and former chief architect of the Department of Architecture Kazi Golam Nasir; current chief architect Asifur Rahman Bhuiyan; former BUET architecture professor and former vice-chancellor of Leading University Professor Qazi Azizul Mowla; and BUET architecture assistant professor Patrick D’ Rozario.

Engineering expertise came from distinguished civil engineer Professor Shamim Z Bosunia, former BUET professor and member of the Padma Bridge expert panel; BUET civil engineering professor Raquib Ahsan; Bangladesh Association of Structural Engineers convener Abdullah Al Hossain Chowdhury; and public works department supervising engineer Shakhawat Hossen.

Urban planning and government perspectives were provided by Rajuk chief urban planner (current charge) Md Ashraful Islam; Housing and Building Research Institute director general Mohammad Giyasuddin Haydar; Dhaka University geology department chairman Professor Badruddoza Miah; Disaster Management and Relief Ministry joint secretary Golam Mostafa; and Fire Service and Civil Defence director, operations, Lieutenant Colonel Mohammad Tajul Islam Chowdhury.

The session was chaired by IAB president Professor Abu Sayed M Ahmed, with IAB vice-presidentfor national affairs Architect Nowajish Mahbub moderating the discussion. IAB general secretary Architect Masud Ur Rashid delivered the welcome address.

Professor Shamim Bosunia stated that proper structural engineering supervision and compliance could ensure safety. ‘If those who are skilled and experienced in structural engineering do their work properly, and if supervision during building construction is done correctly, I think there is no reason to be afraid.’

‘When an earthquake occurs, do not rush down the stairs; take shelter in a safe area. Stay alert without losing your senses. Many lives can be saved through such precautions alone,’ he added.

Architect and urban planner Iqbal Habib highlighted that while earthquakes could not be prevented, damage could be minimised.

He expressed concern over the lack of monitoring in building approval processes and stressed the urgent need for regulatory authority formation, block development and TDR implementation to reduce risks from fire hazards, gas leakage and faulty construction.

Professor Raquib Ahsan noted that not all civil engineers were skilled in earthquake-resistant design.

He called for continuous professional development and training, emphasising the need for architects and engineers to work collaboratively on building safety.

Kazi Golam Nasir cautioned against spreading panic through unscientific earthquake predictions. ‘Instead of fear, we need immediate action: identify vulnerable buildings, widen narrow roads for emergency access, retrofit critical government infrastructure, including hospitals and the Secretariat, secure free-standing furniture to walls, ensure proper soil testing for new construction with skilled professionals and clearly mark emergency exits.’

M Sayed Ahmed emphasised the institute’s commitment to protecting the nation. ‘If we work on post-disaster planning, we can recommend many things to the government. We want to save the country and protect everything in it, we want to survive together.’

The roundtable revealed critical gaps in Dhaka’s disaster response capacity, with only 17 fire stations serving over 30 million people.

Experts unanimously called for urgent action, including building retrofitting, improved building codes, community earthquake drills, and integration of disaster management into school curricula.

TITLE: German suspect in Madeleine McCann case freed from prison

The top suspect in the 2007 disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann in Portugal was freed from a German prison on Wednesday, an AFP journalist at the scene reported.

Christian Brueckner, 48, had been serving a seven-year term at Sehnde prison in northern Germany for rape, but he has not been charged in the McCann case because of a lack of evidence, prosecutors say.

Brueckner was driven away in his lawyer’s car accompanied by two police vans, watched by a large group of journalists who had waited outside the correctional facility.

Prosecutors in Braunschweig have accused him of being behind the disappearance of McCann, widely known as ‘Maddie’, the notorious missing person case which has captivated the world media for years.

Three-year-old Madeleine vanished from her family’s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in May 2007 while her parents dined at a nearby tapas bar.

However, a lack of solid evidence prevented them from laying charges against Brueckner, who denies the claims against him.

This meant that on Wednesday he was a free man, having finished his sentence for raping a 72-year-old American woman in 2005 in Portugal’s Algarve region, where Maddie went missing.

Despite a huge international manhunt, global media attention and multiple leads that went cold, no trace of her has been found and no one has been charged over her disappearance.

German prosecutors in a bombshell announcement in 2020 named Brueckner, who is known to have lived in the area on and off at the time, as their top suspect.

They have said they have unspecified but ‘concrete evidence’ that was nonetheless not enough to secure a conviction, and have therefore refrained from charging him over the Maddie case.

In June, police combed an overgrown area and abandoned buildings in Portugal near where Brueckner lived at the time, but without so far announcing that they have found any evidence.

Days before Brueckner’s release, Braunschweig chief prosecutor Christian Wolters warned that he remains ‘dangerous’ and was considered likely to reoffend.

Prosecutors had applied for conditions on Brueckner’s release, such as making him wear an electronic ankle tag and requiring him to inform them where he lives.

Wolters also voiced fears that Brueckner might leave Germany ‘because of all the media hype’.

Brueckner’s defence lawyer Friedrich Fuelscher told public broadcaster NDR that the comments by the public prosecutor’s office ‘will have an impact on his future life’.

He predicted Brueckner might struggle to find a job or a flat and to reintegrate into society because ‘people will not want to have any kind of contact with a suspected child murderer’.

Brueckner was first convicted of sexually abusing children when he was still a teenager, according to Der Spiegel news magazine.

By 2020, his criminal record contained 17 entries, the magazine reported, including causing bodily injury, theft and drunk driving.

During his latest trial, a psychiatric expert described him as being in the ‘absolute top league of dangerousness’ and highly likely to reoffend, according to German media reports.

At the time he was revealed as a suspect in the McCann case, Brueckner was serving a sentence for drug trafficking.

He was also charged in October 2022 with five separate counts of rape and child sex abuse allegedly committed between 2000 and 2017 in the same region of Portugal where Maddie went missing.

But he was acquitted on all charges, thwarting prosecutors’ hopes of keeping him in jail while they continued to investigate the Maddie case.

Prosecutors in Braunschweig, where Brueckner was tried on the 2022 charges, have applied for a retrial in a different court, but a decision on those proceedings is not expected before next year.

Wolters said German investigations into Maddie’s disappearance were ongoing.

Prosecutors ‘have not yet evaluated everything’ found during the new search in Praia da Luz in June, and there are also still ‘other lines of inquiry’, he said.

Wolters said that ‘we just hope that if we need him again, we’ll be able to get him’.

TITLE: Stock market shows recovery as investors return: DSE chairman

Dhaka Stock Exchange chairman Mominul Islam on Tuesday described the country’s stock market outlook as encouraging, saying that the market has begun to recover as investors are gradually returning.

Mominul made the remarks during a discussion at the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) office on the development of Bangladesh’s capital market, SME company listings, investor confidence, the introduction of new financial products and financing for startups and small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

He praised the interim government for taking unprecedented steps to support the capital market.

Measures in the current budget, including reductions in turnover tax, merchant bank taxes and adjustments in corporate tax rates between listed and unlisted companies, have strengthened market activity, he said.

Mominul also noted that the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) has become more proactive, restoring market discipline through initiatives such as resolving issues related to CC account interest and reducing BO account renewal fees.

These measures, along with limiting unwarranted interventions, have boosted investor confidence.

‘Investors are coming back to the market, and institutional investors are becoming more active. We are also digitizing the IPO process and working to bring strong companies to the market quickly through a green channel,’ Mominul said.

He called for closer collaboration between DSE and DCCI to enhance economic growth and strengthen the stock market in a sustainable way, emphasizing the need to develop the bond market alongside the equity market.

During the session, DCCI president Taskeen Ahmed stressed the importance of increasing SME participation in the capital market and boosting investor confidence.

He suggested both long-term and short-term strategies, including revising the dual taxation system and diversifying financial products.

Highlighting the significant contribution of SMEs to the economy, Taskeen noted that only 360 out of more than 200,000 companies in RJSC are listed, emphasizing the need for greater focus on listing government and multinational companies as well.

‘We need to enhance SME participation in the stock market and focus on building investor confidence. SMEs contribute significantly to the economy, and the capital market has enormous potential to attract investment from these enterprises,’ Taskeen said.

Taskeen also pointed out that Bangladesh’s market capitalization to GDP ratio remains below 20 percent, compared with 40–50 percent in similar economies.

He highlighted the potential of the SME sector, which constitutes around 75 percent of the private sector, noting that the capital market could attract substantial investment from these enterprises.

Both DSE and DCCI agreed to organise separate programs in the near future to facilitate SME listings on the SME Board and the Alternative Trading Board (ATB), further strengthening the market’s role in the country’s economic development.

TITLE: ACC to disclose names if pressure exerted to obstruct graft probe: chair

Anti-Corruption Commission chairman Mohammad Abdul Momen on Tuesday warned that the commission would publicly disclose the names of people who would try to exert pressure on the commission to obstruct graft inquiry and investigation.

Speaking at a views-exchange meeting with journalists on Tuesday at the commission’s headquarters in the capital’s Segunbagicha marking the commission’s founding anniversary, he also said, ‘Those who try to exert pressure — in the future, I will reveal their names.’

Asked whether the ACC faces pressure, he said, ‘Pressure mainly comes on those who are corrupt. If you are not corrupt, if you keep your head straight, the pressure is much less.’

‘Those who want to pressure you will also think twice about whether they should do it. From now on, anyone who tries to exert undue pressure on the ACC, we will reveal their names,’ he added.

Responding to a question about whether the ACC was a ‘toothless tiger’, Momen said, ‘Its teeth are not as sharp as they should have been. The claws haven’t fully grown either. It is somewhere in the middle stage.’

The ACC chairman believes that preventing corruption in different sectors of the country is not the ACC’s responsibility alone.

He proposed harsher punishment for corruption.

‘If the penalty for embezzling Tk 10 crore is set at Tk 100 crore, they wouldn’t dare to do it,’ he said.

Referring to electoral affidavits, Momen said, ‘There is very little time between the submission and finalisation of asset declarations. If the government declared that electoral affidavits must first be submitted to the ACC, we would form a task force.’

‘We might not be able to examine all of them. Not everyone in the country is corrupt. But we could scrutinise key suspects in advance and then forward the information to the Election Commission,’ he added.

Speaking about the national election, the ACC chairman said, ‘We had previously seen the influence of undisclosed money in elections. It may happen again this time.’

Asked whether affidavits would be examined even after the election, he said, ‘There is no reason why they wouldn’t be. We will do it a hundred times.’
